                            <h2>One must imagine Sisyphus writing a new JS framework</h2>
							<img class="bordered-feature-image" src="img/sisyphus.webp" alt="" />
                            <p dir="auto">We inherited incredibly complex systems built by the greatest minds of previous generations.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">With the fatal arrogance of a teenager that got their heart broken for the first time and thinks no one understands them or has ever felt what they feel, we saw their limitations, pitfalls and compromises, and attribuited them to incompetence or even malice. And promptly dedicated our efforts to reinvent the wheel, <em>because we knew better</em>.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">We added layer upon layer of complexity, and each time a new model, theory or framework failed us, rather than reevaluating and stepping back, we added a new one. A patch to fix the uninteded consequences of the previous patch... ad aeternum.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">And a new bureaucratic class of scrum masters, and agile coaches, and productivity gurus was born to manage all of that.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">And then things started to break down.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">What used to be done fast and cheaply now takes orders or magnitude longer, with much bigger teams, and somehow it feels lower quality.<br>
                            We have much greater resources at our disposal and yet we can't seem to achieve things that we already did decades ago.<br>
                            And in an schizophrenic combination of learned helplessness and god complex we deceive ourselves, coming up with rationalizations about how, actually, it can't and it shouldn't be done like that.</p>
                            <blockquote dir="auto">
                            <p>We're doing great!</p>

                            <p dir="auto">(Also, when so many people suffer of impostor syndrome, <i>something</i> is not right)</p>
                            <p dir="auto">But people start to notice anyway, and then new factions started to emerge.</p>

                            <h3 data-heading="The End is NOT nigh" dir="auto">The End is NOT nigh</h3>
                            <p dir="auto">They're all wrong. I say we're actually in a golden age of computing.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">At some point, each generation thinks they have it uniquely difficult. Even <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/673142" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/673142" target="_blank">Socrates</a> (allegedly) believed the youths of his time were proof of the unique decay of his society.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">True, there're issues. Shitty code and bloated, buggy projects are everywhere nowadays, but so is knowledge. It's in our hands to build something better.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">We have access to computers orders of magnitudes more powerful than the mainframes of the <em>olden days</em>, and dirt cheap.<br>
                            In fact, so cheap, I've seen homeless people in the park with laptops.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">You can install a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://xubuntu.org" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://xubuntu.org" target="_blank">light weight Linux distro</a> (free of course) on almost any old piece of junk with a CPU and you'll get a perfectly good programming machine.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">You can choose from probably hundreds of programming languages. Or you can use top quality C/C++ compilers for free (that wasn't a thing back in the day!).</p>
                            <p dir="auto">There's also an incredibly wide selection of free and powerful tools.<br>
                            We even have lengthy discussions about what free editor or IDE is best.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">You can host your code for free and even allow others to review and modify it in places like <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://gitlab.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://gitlab.com" target="_blank">GitLab</a>.<br>
                            They even have CI/CD tools for free as well!<br>
                            And you can use it to read other people's code and learn from it. The source code of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM" target="_blank">Doom</a> is available for you to look around!</p>
                            <p dir="auto">And, thanks to the modern Internet we have free and instant access to programming books, talks, conferences, classes and much more!</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li dir="auto">Harvard publishes CS lectures for free on <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LPJfIKxwWc&amp;list=PLhQjrBD2T381WAHyx1pq-sBfykqMBI7V4&amp;index=1" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LPJfIKxwWc&amp;list=PLhQjrBD2T381WAHyx1pq-sBfykqMBI7V4&amp;index=1" target="_blank"> YouTube </a></li>
                            <li dir="auto">So does the University of Utah about <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVCuWQV_-Es&amp;list=PLplnkTzzqsZS3R5DjmCQsqupu43oS9CFN" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVCuWQV_-Es&amp;list=PLplnkTzzqsZS3R5DjmCQsqupu43oS9CFN" target="_blank">Computer Graphics</a></li>
                            <li dir="auto">You have courses on a lot of different languages and technologies in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.w3schools.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> for free!</li>
                            <li dir="auto">I've also heard there're hidden websites in the dark corners of the interwebs where you can get free pdf copies of books...</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p dir="auto">We have free online communities full of people happy to discuss and teach.</p>

                            <p dir="auto">You're not alone!</p>
                            <p dir="auto">Technology has democratised the production of many things. Empowering tiny teams to compete with (and even beat) multinationals.<br>
                            We're seeing the same phenomenon all over the place:</p>
                            <p dir="auto">Record companies produce bland and repetitive songs from cloned singers.<br>
                            But nowadays anyone can produce an album in their bedrooms. You just need a laptop and a cheap sound card (and maybe not even that).<br>
                            And places like Soundcloud are full of awful music from amateurs as proof of that.<br>
                            But some of those amateurs improve, and grow, and now you have fresh, original, and incredibly niche bands that would've never been able to make a living with their music in years past.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">The film and TV industries are producing increasingly mediocre and boring movies and series.<br>
                            But some <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gk_rl3y_SU" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gk_rl3y_SU" target="_blank">nerdy kids with a laptop webcam</a> have built multimedia empires because now anyone can have access to cheap recording equipment and video editing software.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">The same happened with video games thanks to projects like <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://unity.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://unity.com" target="_blank">Unity</a> or <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.blender.org" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.blender.org" target="_blank">Blender</a>.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">We even have more people writing and selling <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ourworldindata.org/books#all-charts" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/books#all-charts" target="_blank">books</a> than ever before!</p>
                            <p dir="auto">And <em>YOU</em> can do the same for software.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">Big companies are the main ones producing all that bloated buggy code. They grew too big and fat, with tons of legacy code. Now they move slowly and can't take any risks.<br>
                            The democratisation of code opened the flood gates and <em>a lot</em> of shitty code and shitty devs poured in, but so did a lot of talented devs that just need some experience. And experienced ones that just needed a push.</p>

                            <p dir="auto">These were all built (or at least created) by single devs, passionate for their craft. And there are many other examples.<br>
                            I personally like the collection of the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://handmade.network/projects" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://handmade.network/projects" target="_blank">Handmade Network</a>.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">I love the concept of "recreational programming" pushed by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily" target="_blank">Tsoding</a>.<br>
                            And people like <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen" target="_blank">ThePrimeagen</a>, and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/@LowLevel-TV" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@LowLevel-TV" target="_blank">Low Level Learning</a> not only demystify a lot of the scary parts of software, they also have a contagious passion about it.</p>
                            <p dir="auto">Now, some of these people are very opinionated about <em>the right way</em> to write software. I tend to agree with them, but that's not the point of this article.<br>
                            Forget about <em>the right way</em>. Just build stuff! Build crappy software. Refine it, tweak it, learn from it, improve. Find something you're excited about, or a piece of software you don't like, and write code.<br>
                            Don't let the doomsayers scare you, but remember to put love and care into it.</p>
